       Troubleshooting Tips for CodeTrack v. 0.99


 Step 0a (pre-troubleshooting)

    Initial login is admin/codetrack


 Step 0b (pre-troubleshooting)

     Create a simple php file in the codetrack directory containing phpinfo();
     If you can't see this in a browser, then get help.  Something is seriously
     broken (or maybe trivial-but-vital).


 1.  Re-read the permissions instructions in INSTALL.txt (95% of CodeTrack
     problems are related to overly-restrictive permissions.  Apache *must*
     have read priveleges for all fies, read+write for all xml files, and
     read+write+execute on all directories.  On most Unixes, this means that
     the higher level directories must be similarly opened.  See the Purple
     book (formerly the Red book) for more info.

      Here is an example of a CodeTrack installation with reasonable permissions set
      (note the differences in directory entries):

            [root@staging codetrack]# ls -lh
            total 184k
            drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 attachments
            drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 backups
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody       1.5k Mar 13 21:16 bugs.dtd
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody       117k Mar 14 21:28 codetrack.php
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody       7.7k Mar 14 22:35 config.inc.php
            drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 docs
            drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 images
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody        128 Jul 23  2003 index.html
            drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 javascript
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody        483 Mar  7 21:07 permissions.dtd
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody        623 Mar  7 21:07 projects.dtd
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody       1.6k Mar 14 21:06 README.txt
            drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 style
            -rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody        843 Mar  7 21:07 users.dtd
            drwxr-xr-x    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:35 xml


      For a slightly more secure setup, here is an example of a CodeTrack installation with
      stricter permissions set (note that only the XML, attachments and backups directories
      are writable).

            [root@staging codetrack]# ls -lh
            total 184k
            drw-------    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 attachments
            drw-------    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 backups
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody       1.5k Mar 13 21:16 bugs.dtd
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody       117k Mar 14 21:28 codetrack.php
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody       7.7k Mar 14 22:35 config.inc.php
            drw-------    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 docs
            dr--------    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 images
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody        128 Jul 23  2003 index.html
            dr--------    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 javascript
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody        483 Mar  7 21:07 permissions.dtd
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody        623 Mar  7 21:07 projects.dtd
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody       1.6k Mar 14 21:06 README.txt
            dr--------    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:23 style
            -rw-------    1 nobody   nobody        843 Mar  7 21:07 users.dtd
            drw-------    2 nobody   nobody       4.0k Mar 14 22:35 xml
            

2.   Verify that your hostname is correct.  Many folks have a broken Linux
     installation, but just didn't realize it yet.  If you want to use
     e-mail, try typing "hostname" or "hostname --fqdn" at a command prompt.
     If it reads localhost or localhost.localdomain, this is wrong.

     With a setup like this, Apache is reporting a bogus hostname (unless you
     are truly running it *only* for local development), and this can affect SSL,
     cookies, and definately e-mail delivery.  Most company's e-mail servers would
     reject mail originating from "localhost.localdomain" as a bogus address,
     possibly dropping messages because of spam.  This can be the case even when
     you are sending mail to other users *inside* your own organization!


3.  Check the mail log.  On Linux, it's often located at:  /var/log/maillog
    Do a "tail" on your mail log for a good breakdown on what happened:

        tail /var/log/maillog

    If you see entries referring to "timeout", this may be caused by draconian
    firewall rules, or a spam filter.  If you see warnings about untrusted
    user "nobody" changing the origin address, this is not necessarily wrong,
    but means that the user running your webserver is not on the sendmail (or
    qmail) trusted user list.  I don't recommend you pursue this path unless
    you have ruled out the more common problems with invalid hostname or DNS (see
    below).


4.  Rule out the possibility of a broken DNS.  From a command prompt, try:

      nslookup name.of.your.machine

    If you get something other than what you expect, talk to your local system
    admin.  This is critical.


5.  Another thing to try is to set up a Hotmail or Yahoo Mail account, and try
    setting one of your users up with an email address there.  As of early 2002,
    these organizations block virtually nothing, and will usually allow very broken
    mail messages in.  If this works, then revisit your hostname settings, along
    with the return email address setting in codetrack.inc.php:

      DEFINE ("CT_RETURN_ADDRESS", "me@mycompany.org" );

    In the vast majority of cases, this is the culprit.  If you've tried everything
    else, and are running a PHP version 4.05 or higher, another possibility is
    to disable the "envelope return address" -- ONLY available on non-Windows
    PHP from version 4.05 higher:

      DEFINE ( "CT_USE_EXTRA_MAIL_HEADER", FALSE );

    Note that this is not a "magic bullet" -- usually it is a bandaid of last
    resort for draconian anti-spam SMTP servers, and it WILL generate (benign)
    warnings in your mail log.


6. Windows users -- re-read INSTALL.txt for setting up php.ini the first time
   for proper mail delivery.  Note that you do NOT have to run a mail server,
   and can often use your ISP's SMTP box as an outbound relay.
