<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhatDoesGPLStandFor" NAME="WhatDoesGPLStandFor">What does "GPL" stand for?</a></h4>

<dd>"GPL" stands for "General Public License".  The most widespread such
license is the GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL for short.  This
can be further shortened to "GPL", when it is understood that the GNU
GPL is the one intended.

<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCDoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL" NAME="DoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL">
Does free software mean using the GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>
Not at all--there are many other free software licenses.  We have an
<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html"> incomplete
list</a>.  Any license that provides the user <a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">certain specific
freedoms</a> is a free software license.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhyUseGPL" NAME="WhyUseGPL">
Why should I use the GNU GPL rather than other free software licenses?</a></h4>

<dd>
Using the GNU GPL will require that all the <a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html">released improved versions be free
software</a>.  This means you can avoid the risk of having to compete
with a proprietary modified version of your own work.  However, in
some special situations it can be better to use a
<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> more permissive license</a>.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCDoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense" NAME="DoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense">
Does all GNU software use the GNU GPL as its license?</a></h4>

<dd>
Most GNU software packages use the GNU GPL, but there are a few
GNU programs (and parts of programs) that use looser licenses, such as the
Lesser GPL.  When we do this, it is a matter of <a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"> strategy</a>.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCDoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware" NAME="DoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware">
Does using the GPL for a program make it GNU software?</a></h4>

<dd>
Anyone can release a program under the GNU GPL but that does not
make it a GNU package.
<p>
Making the program a GNU software package means explicitly
contributing to the GNU Project.  This happens when the program's
developers and the GNU Project agree to do it.  If you are interested
in contributing a program to the GNU Project, please write to
<a HREF="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">&lt;maintainers@gnu.org&gt;</a>.

<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCReportingViolation" NAME="ReportingViolation">
What should I do if I discover a possible violation of the GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>
You should <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html">report it.</a>
First, check the facts as best you can.  Then tell the publisher or
copyright holder of the specific GPL-covered program.  If that is the
Free Software Foundation, write to <a
HREF="mailto:license-violation@gnu.org">&lt;license-violation@gnu.org&gt;</a>.  
Otherwise, the program's maintainer may be the copyright holder, or
else could tell you how to contact the copyright holder, so report it
to the maintainer.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions" NAME="WhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions">
Why does the GPL permit users to publish their modified versions?</a></h4>

<dd>
A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate.
It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other
to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users.
<p>
Some have proposed alternatives to the GPL that require modified
versions to go through the original author.  As long as the original
author keeps up with the need for maintenance, this may work well in
practice, but if the author stops (more or less) to do something else
or does not attend to all the users' needs, this scheme falls down.
Aside from the practical problems, this scheme does not allow users to
help each other.
<p>
Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of
preventing confusion between various versions made by users.  In our
experience, this confusion is not a major problem.  Many versions of
Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project, but users can tell them
apart.  The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her
name on it, to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the
reputations of other maintainers.

        NAME="GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">
        Does the GPL require that source code of modified versions be
        posted to the public?</a></h4>

<dd>
The GPL does not require you to release your modified version.  You are
free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever
releasing them.  This applies to organizations (including companies),
too; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally
without ever releasing it outside the organization.
<p>

But <em>if</em> you release the modified version to the public in some
way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available
to the program's users, under the GPL.
<p>
Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in
certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to
release it is up to you.

No.  The GPL gives him permission to make and redistribute copies of
the program <em>if he chooses to do so</em>.  He also has the right
not to redistribute the program, if that is what he chooses.

<dd>
"Valid for any third party" means that anyone who has the offer
is entitled to take you up on it.
<p>

If you commercially distribute binaries not accompanied with source
code, the GPL says you must provide a written offer to distribute the
source code later.  When users non-commercially redistribute the
binaries they received from you, they must pass along a copy of this
written offer.  This means that people who did not get the binaries
directly from you can still receive copies of the source code, along with
the written offer.
<p>
The reason we require the offer to be valid for any third party
is so that people who receive the binaries indirectly in that way
can order the source code from you.

<dd>
Section 2 says that modified versions you distribute must be licensed
to all third parties under the GPL.  "All third parties" means
absolutely everyone--but this does not require you to *do* anything
physically for them.  It only means they have a license from you,

You are not required to claim a copyright on your changes.  In most
countries, however, that happens automatically by default, so you need to
place your changes explicitly in the public domain if you do not want them
to be copyrighted.

<p>
Whether you claim a copyright on your changes or not, either way you

You can do that, if you can figure out which part is the public domain

<dd>
No.  In fact, a requirement like that would make the program non-free.
If people have to pay when they get a copy of a program, or if they
have to notify anyone in particular, then the program is not free.
See the <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">

The GPL is a free software license, and therefore it permits people

No.  However, if someone pays your fee and gets a copy, the GPL gives

For example, someone could pay your fee, and then put her copy on a
web site for the general public.

No.  The GPL says that anyone who receives a copy of your version from you

It does not give you permission to distribute the work on any more
restrictive basis.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCDevelopChangesUnderNDA" NAME="DevelopChangesUnderNDA">
  Does the GPL allow me to develop a modified version under a

Yes.  For instance, you can accept a contract to develop changes and
agree not to release <em>your changes</em> until the client says ok.
This is permitted because in this case no GPL-covered code is
being distributed under an NDA.
<p>
You can also release your changes to the client under the GPL, but
agree not to release them to anyone else unless the client says ok.  In
this case, too, no GPL-covered code is being distributed under an NDA,
or under any additional restrictions.
<p>
The GPL would give the client the right to redistribute your version.
In this scenario, the client will probably choose not to exercise that right,
but does <em>have</em> the right.

<dd>
You can certainly get credit for the work.  Part of releasing a
program under the GPL is writing a copyright notice in your own name
(assuming you are the copyright holder).  The GPL requires all copies

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhyMustIInclude" NAME="WhyMustIInclude">Why does the GPL

<dd>
Including a copy of the license with the work is vital so that
everyone who gets a copy of the program can know what his rights are.
<p>
It might be tempting to include a URL that refers to the license,
instead of the license itself.  But you cannot be sure that the URL
will still be valid, five years or ten years from now.  Twenty years
from now, URLs as we know them today may no longer exist.
<p>
The only way to make sure that people who have copies of the program
will continue to be able to see the license, despite all the changes
that will happen in the network, is to include a copy of the license in
the program.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhatIfWorkIsShort" NAME="WhatIfWorkIsShort">What
        if the work is not much longer than the license itself?</a></h4>

If a single program is that short, you may as well use a simple
all-permissive license for it, rather than the GNU GPL.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLOmitPreamble"
        NAME="GPLOmitPreamble">
        Can I omit the preamble of the GPL, or the instructions
        for how to use it on your own programs, to save space?</a></h4>
<dd>
The preamble and instructions are integral parts of the GNU GPL and
may not be omitted.  In fact, the GPL is copyrighted, and its license
permits only verbatim copying of the entire GPL.  (You can use the
legal terms to make <a HREF="#ModifyGPL">another license</a> but it
won't be the GNU GPL.)
<p>
The preamble and instructions add up to some 5000 characters, less
than 1/3 of the GPL's total size.  They will not make a substantial
fractional change in the size of a software package unless the package
itself is quite small.  In that case, you may as well use a simple
all-permissive license rather than the GNU GPL.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhatIsCompatible" NAME="WhatIsCompatible">What does it
        mean to say that two licenses are "compatible"?</a></h4>

<dd>
In order to combine two programs (or substantial parts of them) into a
larger work, you need to have permission to use both programs in this
way.  If the two programs' licenses permit this, they are compatible.
If there is no way to satisfy both licenses at once, they are
incompatible.
<p>
For some licenses, the way in which the combination is made may affect
whether they are compatible--for instance, they may allow linking two
modules together, but not allow merging their code into one module.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhatDoesCompatMean" NAME="WhatDoesCompatMean">What
does it mean to say a license is "compatible with the GPL".</a></h4>

<dd>
It means that the other license and the GNU GPL are compatible;
you can combine code released under the other license with code
released under the GNU GPL in one larger program.
<p>
The GPL permits such a combination provided it is released under the
GNU GPL.  The other license is compatible with the GPL if it permits
this too.

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCFSWithNFLibs" name="FSWithNFLibs">Can I write
free software that uses non-free libraries?</a></h4>

<dd>
If you do this, your program won't be fully usable in a free
environment. If your program depends on a non-free library to do a
certain job, it cannot do that job in the Free World. If it depends on a
non-free library to run at all, it cannot be part of a free operating
system such as GNU; it is entirely off limits to the Free World.
<p>
So please consider: can you find a way to get the job done without using
this library? Can you write a free replacement for that library?
<p>
If the program is already written using the non-free library, perhaps it
is too late to change the decision. You may as well release the program
as it stands, rather than not release it. But please mention in the
README that the need for the non-free library is a drawback, and suggest
the task of changing the program so that it does the same job without
the non-free library.  Please suggest that anyone who thinks of doing
substantial further work on the program first free it from dependence
on the non-free library.
<p>
Note that there may also be legal issues with combining certain non-free
libraries with GPL-covered Free Software.  Please see <a

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLIncompatibleLibs" name="GPLIncompatibleLibs">What
legal issues come up if I use GPL-incompatible libraries with GPL
software?</a></h4>

<p>
If the libraries that you link with fall within the following exception
in the GPL:
<blockquote>       
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
     include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
     binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
then you don't have to do anything special to use them; the requirement
to distribute source code for the whole program does not include those
libraries, even if you distribute a linked executable containing them.
Thus, if the libraries you need come with major parts of a proprietary
operating system, the GPL says people can link your program with them
without any conditions.
</p><p>       
If you want your program to link against a library not covered by that
exception, you need to add your own exception, wholly outside of the
GPL. This copyright notice and license notice give permission to link
with the program FOO:

<blockquote>

</p><p>
    In addition, as a special exception, &lt;name of copyright
    holder&gt; gives permission to link the code of this program with
    the FOO library (or with modified versions of FOO that use the
    same license as FOO), and distribute linked combinations including
    the two.  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all
    respects for all of the code used other than FOO.  If you modify
    this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to
    do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
</blockquote>
</p><p>

Only the copyright holders for the program can legally authorize this
exception. If you wrote the whole program yourself, then assuming your
employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are the copyright
holder--so you can authorize the exception. But if you want to use parts
of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your code, you cannot
authorize the exception for them. You have to get the approval of the
copyright holders of those programs.
</p><p>
When other people modify the program, they do not have to make the same
exception for their code--it is their choice whether to do so.

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCHowIGetCopyright" NAME="HowIGetCopyright">How do I
  get a copyright on my program in order to release it under the
  GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>
Under the Berne Convention, everything written is automatically
copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form.  So you don't have
to do anything to "get" the copyright on what you write--as long as
nobody else can claim to own your work.
<p>
However, registering the copyright in the US is a very good idea.  It
will give you more clout in dealing with an infringer in the US.
<p>

The case when someone else might possibly claim the copyright is if
you are an employee or student; then the employer or the school might
claim you did the job for them and that the copyright belongs to them.
Whether they would have a valid claim would depend on circumstances
such as the laws of the place where you live, and on your employment
contract and what sort of work you do.  It is best to consult a lawyer
if there is any possible doubt.
<p>
If you think that the employer or school might have a claim, you can
resolve the problem clearly by getting a copyright disclaimer signed
by a suitably authorized officer of the company or school.  (Your
immediate boss or a professor is usually NOT authorized to sign such a
disclaimer.)

of the knowledge and information they develop, in effect behaving
little different from commercial businesses.  (See "The Kept
University", Atlantic Monthly, March 2000, for a general discussion of
this problem and its effects.)
<p>
If you see any chance that your school might refuse to allow your
program to be released as free software, it is best to raise the issue
at the earliest possible stage.  The closer the program is to working
usefully, the more temptation the administration might feel to take it
from you and finish it without you.  At an earlier stage, you have
more leverage.
<p>
So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only
half-done, saying, "If you will agree to releasing this as free
software, I will finish it."  Don't think of this as a bluff.  To
prevail, you must have the courage to say, "My program will have
liberty, or never be born."

The GNU GPL does not give users permission to attach other licenses to
the program.  But the copyright holder for a program can release it
under several different licenses in parallel.  One of them may be the
GNU GPL.

The license that comes in your copy, assuming it was put in by the

To release a non-free program is always ethically tainted, but legally
there is no obstacle to your doing this.  If you are the copyright

Strictly speaking, the GPL is a license from the developer for others
to use, distribute and change the program.  The developer itself is
not bound by it, so no matter what the developer does, this is not
a "violation" of the GPL.
<p>
However, if the developer does something that would violate the GPL if

<dd>
Yes, because the copyright on the editors and tools does not cover the
code you write.  Using them does not place any restrictions, legally,
on the license you use for your code.
<p>
Some programs copy parts of themselves into the output for technical
reasons--for example, Bison copies a standard parser program into its
output file.  In such cases, the copied text in the output is covered
by the same license that covers it in the source code.  Meanwhile, the
part of the output which is derived from the program's input inherits
the copyright status of the input.
<p>
As it happens, Bison can also be used to develop non-free programs.
This is because we decided to explicitly permit the use of the Bison
standard parser program in Bison output files without restriction.  We
made the decision because there were other tools comparable to Bison
which already permitted use for non-free programs.

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLFairUse" NAME="GPLFairUse">Do I have "fair use"

Yes, you do.  "Fair use" is use that is allowed without any special
permission.  Since you don't need the developers' permission for such
use, you can do it regardless of what the developers said about it--in
the license or elsewhere, whether that license be the GNU GPL or any
other free software license.

If the program is written by US government employees, it is in the

GPL.  (It can still be <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"> free
software</a>, however; a public domain program is free.)
<p>
However, when a US government agency uses contractors to develop
software, that is a different situation.  The contract can require the
contractor to release it under the GNU GPL.  (GNU Ada was developed in
this way.)  Or the contract can assign the copyright to the government

<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLUSGovAdd" NAME="GPLUSGovAdd">Can the US Government

the improvements are in the public domain.  However, the improved
version, as a whole, is still covered by the GNU GPL.  There is no

If the US government uses contractors to do the job, then the
improvements themselves can be GPL-covered.

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLOutput" NAME="GPLOutput">Is there some way that
  I can GPL the output people get from use of my program?  For example,
  if my program is used to develop hardware designs, can I require that
  these designs must be free?</a></h4>

<dd>
In general this is legally impossible; copyright law does not give you
any say in the use of the output people make from their data using
your program.  If the user uses your program to enter or convert his
own data, the copyright on the output belongs to him, not you.  More
generally, when a program translates its input into some other form,
the copyright status of the output inherits that of the input it was
generated from.
<p>
So the only way you have a say in the use of the output is if
substantial parts of the output are copied (more or less) from text in
your program.  For instance, part of the output of Bison (see above)
would be covered by the GNU GPL, if we had not made an exception in
this specific case.
<p>

You could artificially make a program copy certain text into its
output even if there is no technical reason to do so.  But if that
copied text serves no practical purpose, the user could simply delete
that text from the output and use only the rest.  Then he would not
have to obey the conditions on redistribution of the copied text.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhatCaseIsOutputGPL" NAME="WhatCaseIsOutputGPL">In what cases is the output of a GPL program covered by the GPL too?</a></h4>

The GPL says that the whole combined program has to be released under
the GPL.  So your module has to be available for use under the GPL.
<p>
But you can give additional permission for the use of your code.  You
can, if you wish, release your program under a license which is more

  GPL-compatible licenses?</a></h4>

<dd>
When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is no.  The
interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; a free software
license like the GPL, based on copyright law, cannot limit what data you
use the interpreter on.  You can run it on any data (interpreted program),
any way you like, and there are no requirements about licensing that data
to anyone.

<p>
However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings.  So if these facilities are released under the
GPL, the interpreted program that uses them must be released in a
GPL-compatible way.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of
such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way are linked
dynamically with the Java programs that call them.
<p>
Another similar and very common case is to provide libraries with the
interpreter which are themselves interpreted.  For instance, Perl
comes with many Perl modules, and a Java implementation comes with
many Java classes.  These libraries and the programs that call them
are always dynamically linked together.
<p>
A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on.

  released under the GPL uses plug-ins, what are the requirements for
  the licenses of a plug-in.</a></h4>

<dd>
It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins.  If the program
uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate
programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements
for them.
<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a
single program, so plug-ins must be treated as extensions to the main
program.  This means they must be released under the GPL or a
GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL
must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.

<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication
between them is limited to invoking the `main' function of the plug-in
with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline
case.

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLPluginsInNF" NAME="GPLPluginsInNF">Can I use the

If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the
plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program
makes no requirements for them.  So you can use the GPL for a plug-in,
and there are no special requirements.
<p>
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a
single program, so plug-ins must be treated as extensions to the main
program.  This means that linking the GPL-covered plug-in with the
main program would violate the GPL.  However, you can resolve that
legal problem by adding an exception to your program's license
which gives permission to link it with the non-free main program.

To answer this question, we would need to see a list of each component

uses that component.  Two examples would be:
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCMereAggregation" NAME="MereAggregation">What is the
  difference between "mere aggregation" and "combining two modules into
  one program"?</a></h4>

<dd>
Mere aggregation of two programs means putting them side by side on
the same CD-ROM or hard disk.  We use this term in the case where they
are separate programs, not parts of a single program.  In this case,
if one of the programs is covered by the GPL, it has no effect on the
other program.
<p>
Combining two modules means connecting them together so that they form
a single larger program.  If either part is covered by the GPL, the
whole combination must also be released under the GPL--if you can't,
or won't, do that, you may not combine them.
<p>

What constitutes combining two parts into one program?  This is a
legal question, which ultimately judges will decide.  We believe that
a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication
(exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.)
and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are
interchanged).
<p>
If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are
definitely combined in one program.  If modules are designed to run
linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means
combining them into one program.
<p>
By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are
communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs.
So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are
separate programs.  But if the semantics of the communication are
intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too
could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger
program.

<dd>
Our lawyers have told us that to be in the <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html">best position to enforce
the GPL</a> in court against violators, we should keep the copyright status
of the program as simple as possible.  We do this by asking each contributor
to either assign the copyright on his contribution to the FSF, or disclaim
copyright on it and thus put it in the public domain.
<p>
We also ask individual contributors to get copyright disclaimers from
their employers (if any) so that we can be sure those employers won't
claim to own the contributions.

<p>

Of course, if all the contributors put their code in the public
domain, there is no copyright with which to enforce the GPL.  So we
encourage people to assign copyright on large code contributions, and
only put small changes in the public domain.

<p>

<dd>
You are allowed to sell copies of the modified program commercially,
but only under the terms of the GNU GPL.  Thus, for instance, you must

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLInProprietarySystem"
  NAME="GPLInProprietarySystem">I'd like to incorporate GPL-covered
  software in my proprietary system.  Can I do this?</a></h4>

<dd>
You cannot incorporate GPL-covered software in a proprietary system.
The goal of the GPL is to grant everyone the freedom to copy,
redistribute, understand, and modify a program.  If you could
incorporate GPL-covered software into a non-free system, it would have
the effect of making the GPL-covered software non-free too.
<p>
A system incorporating a GPL-covered program is an extended version of
that program.  The GPL says that any extended version of the program
must be released under the GPL if it is released at all.  This is for
two reasons: to make sure that users who get the software get the
freedom they should have, and to encourage people to give back
improvements that they make.
<p>

However, in many cases you can distribute the GPL-covered software
alongside your proprietary system.  To do this validly, you must make
sure that the free and non-free programs communicate at arms length,
that they are not combined in a way that would make them
effectively a single program.
<p>
The difference between this and "incorporating" the GPL-covered
software is partly a matter of substance and partly form.  The
substantive part is this: if the two programs are combined so that
they become effectively two parts of one program, then you can't treat
them as two separate programs.  So the GPL has to cover the whole
thing.
<p>
If the two programs remain well separated, like the compiler and the
kernel, or like an editor and a shell, then you can treat them as two
separate programs--but you have to do it properly.  The issue is
simply one of form: how you describe what you are doing.  Why do we
care about this?  Because we want to make sure the users clearly
understand the free status of the GPL-covered software in the
collection.
<p>
If people were to distribute GPL-covered software calling it "part of"
a system that users know is partly proprietary, users might be
uncertain of their rights regarding the GPL-covered software.  But if they
know that what they have received is a free program plus another
program, side by side, their rights will be clear.

  GPL permit this?</a></h4>

<dd>
There are two reasons for this.
<p>
First, a general one.  If we permitted company A to make a proprietary
file, and company B to distribute GPL-covered software linked with
that file, the effect would be to make a hole in the GPL big enough to
drive a truck through.  This would be carte blanche for withholding
the source code for all sorts of modifications and extensions to
GPL-covered software.
<p>

Giving all users access to the source code is one of our main goals,
so this consequence is definitely something we want to avoid.
<p>
More concretely, the versions of the programs linked with the Money
Guzzler libraries would not really be free software as we understand
the term--they would not come with full source code that enables users
to change and recompile the program.

<dd>
If a program P is released under the GPL that means *any and every part of
it* can be used under the GPL.  If you integrate module Q, and release the
combined program P+Q under the GPL, that means any part of P+Q can be used

that Q any part of it can be used under the GPL.  Putting it in other
words, a user who obtains P+Q under the GPL can delete P, so that just Q
remains, still under the GPL.
<p>
If the license of module Q permits you to give permission for that,
then it is GPL-compatible.  Otherwise, it is not GPL-compatible.
<p>
If the license for Q says in no uncertain terms that you must do certain
things (not compatible with the GPL) when you redistribute Q on its own,
then it does not permit you to distribute Q under the GPL.  It follows that
you can't release P+Q under the GPL either.  So you cannot link or combine
P with Q.

You're supposed to provide the source code by mail-order on a physical

to copy the corresponding source code by FTP, in addition to the
mail-order option, but FTP access to the source is not sufficient to
satisfy section 3 of the GPL.
<p>
When a user orders the source, you have to make sure to get the source
to that user.  If a particular user can conveniently get the source
from you by anonymous FTP, fine--that does the job.  But not every
user can do such a download.  The rest of the users are just as
entitled to get the source code from you, which means you must be
prepared to send it to them by post.
<p>
If the FTP access is convenient enough, perhaps no one will choose to
mail-order a copy.  If so, you will never have to ship one.  But you

Yes, you can.  The offer must be open to everyone who has a copy

arrangements with another site to keep the necessary source code
available, and put a link or cross-reference to the source code next
to the binaries, we think that qualifies as "from the same place".
<p>
Note, however, that it is not enough to find some site that happens to
have the appropriate source code today, and tell people to look there.
Tomorrow that site may have deleted that source code, or simply
replaced it with a newer version of the same program.  Then you would
no longer be complying with the GPL requirements.  To make a
reasonable effort to comply, you need to make a positive arrangement
with the other site, and thus ensure that the source will be available

It is essential for people to have the freedom to make modifications

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhySomeGPLAndNotLGPL"
  NAME="WhySomeGPLAndNotLGPL">Why are some GNU libraries released under
  the ordinary GPL rather than the Lesser GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>
Using the Lesser GPL for any particular library constitutes a retreat
for free software.  It means we partially abandon the attempt to
defend the users' freedom, and some of the requirements to share what
is built on top of GPL-covered software.  In themselves, those are
changes for the worse.
<p>
Sometimes a localized retreat is a good strategy.  Sometimes, using
the LGPL for a library might lead to wider use of that library, and
thus to more improvement for it, wider support for free software, and
so on.  This could be good for free software if it happens to a large
extent.  But how much will this happen?  We can only speculate.
<p>
It would be nice to try out the LGPL on each library for a while, see
whether it helps, and change back to the GPL if the LGPL didn't help.
But this is not feasible.  Once we use the LGPL for a particular
library, changing back would be difficult.
<p>
So we decide which license to use for each library on a case-by-case
basis.  There is a <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">
long explanation</a> of how we judge the question.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWillYouMakeAnException"
  NAME="WillYouMakeAnException">Using a certain GNU program under the
  GPL does not fit our project to make proprietary software.  Will you
  make an exception for us?  It would mean more users of that
  program.</a></h4>

<dd>
Sorry, we don't make such exceptions.  It would not be right.
<p>
Maximizing the number of users is not our aim.  Rather, we are trying
to give the crucial freedoms to as many users as possible.  In
general, proprietary software projects hinder rather than help the
cause of freedom.
<p>
We do occasionally make license exceptions to assist a project which
is producing free software under a license other than the GPL.
However, we have to see a good reason why this will advance the cause
of free software.
<p>
We also do sometimes change the distribution terms of a package, when
that seems clearly the right way to serve the cause of free software;
but we are very cautious about this, so you will have to show us very
convincing reasons.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCVersionTwoOrLater" NAME="VersionTwoOrLater">Why
should programs say "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version"?</a></h4>

<dd>
From time to time, at intervals of years, we change the GPL--sometimes
to clarify it, sometimes to permit certain kinds of use not previously
permitted, and sometimes to tighten up a requirement.  (The last
change was in 1991.)  Using this "indirect pointer" in each program
makes it possible for us to change the distribution terms on the
entire collection of GNU software, when we update the GPL.
<p>
If each program lacked the indirect pointer, we would be forced to
discuss the change at length with numerous copyright holders, which
would be a virtual impossibility.  In practice, the chance of having
uniform distribution terms for GNU software would be nil.
<p>
Suppose a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version" and
a new version of the GPL is released.  If the new GPL version gives
additional permission, that permission will be available immediately
to all the users of the program.  But if the new GPL version has a
tighter requirement, it will not restrict use of the current version
of the program, because it can still be used under GPL version 2.
When a program says "Version 2 of the GPL or any later version", users
will always be permitted to use it, and even change it, according to
the terms of GPL version 2--even after later versions of the GPL are
available.
<p>
If a tighter requirement in a new version of the GPL need not be
obeyed for existing software, how is it useful?  Once GPL version 3 is
available, the developers of most GPL-covered programs will release
subsequent versions of their programs specifying "Version 3 of the GPL
or any later version".  Then users will have to follow the tighter
requirements in GPL version 3, for subsequent versions of the program.
<p>
However, developers are not obligated to do this; developers can
continue allowing use of the previous version of the GPL, if that is
their preference.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhyNotGPLForManuals" NAME="WhyNotGPLForManuals">Why
don't you use the GPL for manuals?</a></h4>

<dd>
It is possible to use the GPL for a manual, but the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL) is much better for manuals.

<p>
The GPL was designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses
that are crucial for programs, but that would be cumbersome and
unnecessary for a book or manual.  For instance, anyone publishing the
book on paper would have to either include machine-readable "source
code" of the book along with each printed copy, or provide a written
offer to send the "source code" later.
<p>
Meanwhile, the GFDL has clauses that help publishers of free manuals
make a profit from selling copies--cover texts, for instance.  The
special rules for Endorsements sections make it possible to use the
GFDL for an official standard.  This would permit modified versions,
but they could not be labeled as "the standard".
<p>
Using the GFDL, we permit changes in the text of a manual that covers
its technical topic.  It is important to be able to change the
technical parts, because people who change a program ought to change
the documentation to correspond.  The freedom to do this is an
ethical imperative.
<p>
Our manuals also include sections that state our political position
about free software.  We mark these as "invariant", so that they
cannot be changed or removed.  The GFDL makes provisions for these
"invariant sections".
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCGPLTranslations" NAME="GPLTranslations">Are there
translations of the GPL into other languages?</a></h4>

<dd>
It would be useful to have translations of the GPL into languages
other than English.  People have even written translations and sent
them to us.  But we have not dared to approve them as officially
valid.  That carries a risk so great we do not dare accept it.
<p>
A legal document is in some ways like a program.  Translating it is
like translating a program from one language and operating system to
another.  Only a lawyer skilled in both languages can do it--and even
then, there is a risk of introducing a bug.

<p>
If we were to approve, officially, a translation of the GPL, we would
be giving everyone permission to do whatever the translation says they
can do.  If it is a completely accurate translation, that is fine.
But if there is an error in the translation, the results could be a
disaster which we could not fix.
<p>
If a program has a bug, we can release a new version, and eventually
the old version will more or less disappear.  But once we have given
everyone permission to act according to a particular translation, we
have no way of taking back that permission if we find, later on, that
it had a bug.
<p>
Helpful people sometimes offer to do the work of translation for us.
If the problem were a matter of finding someone to do the work, this
would solve it.  But the actual problem is the risk of error, and
offering to do the work does not avoid the risk.  We could not
possibly authorize a translation written by a non-lawyer.
<p>
Therefore, for the time being, we are not approving translations
of the GPL as globally valid and binding.  Instead, we are doing two
things:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Referring people to unofficial translations.
<p>
This means that we permit people to write translations of the GPL, but
we don't approve them as legally valid and binding.
<p>
An unapproved translation has no legal force, and it should say so
explicitly.  It should be marked as follows:
<p>

<pre>
    This translation of the GPL is informal, and not officially approved
    by the Free Software Foundation as valid.  To be completely sure of
    what is permitted, refer to the original GPL (in English).
</pre>
<p>
But the unapproved translation can serve as a hint for how to
understand the English GPL.  For many users, that is sufficient.
<p>
However, businesses using GNU software in commercial activity, and
people doing public ftp distribution, should need to check the real
English GPL to make sure of what it permits.
<p>
<li>
Publishing translations valid for a single country only.
<p>
We are considering the idea of publishing translations which are
officially valid only for one country.  This way, if there is a
mistake, it will be limited to that country, and the damage will not
be too great.
<p>
It will still take considerable expertise and effort from a sympathetic
and capable lawyer to make a translation, so we cannot promise any
such translations soon.
</ul>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCInterpreterIncompat" NAME="InterpreterIncompat">If
a programming language interpreter has a license that is incompatible
with the GPL, can I run GPL-covered programs on it?</a></h4>

<dd>

When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is yes.
The interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; the GPL
doesn't restrict what tools you process the program with.

However, when the interpreter is extended to provide "bindings" to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the
interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses
through these bindings.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an
example of such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way
are linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them.

So if these facilities are released under a GPL-incompatible license,
the situation is like linking in any other way with a GPL-incompatible
library.  Which implies that:

<ol>
  <li>If you are writing code and releasing it under the GPL, you can
  state an explicit exception giving permission to link it with those
  GPL-incompatible facilities.<p>

  <li>If you wrote and released the program under the GPL, and you
  designed it specifically to work with those facilities, people can
  take that as an implicit exception permitting them to link it with
  those facilities.  But if that is what you intend, it is better
  to say so explicitly.<p>

  <li>You can't take someone else's GPL-covered code and use it that
  way, or add such exceptions to it.  Only the copyright holders of that
  code can add the exception.

</ol>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCWhoHasThePower" NAME="WhoHasThePower">Who has the
power to enforce the GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>

Since the GPL is a copyright license, the copyright holders of the
software are the ones who have the power to enforce the GPL.  If you
see a violation of the GPL, you should inform the developers of the
GPL-covered software involved.  They either are the copyright holders,
or are connected with the copyright holders.  <a

language such as Java, if I use a class that is GPL'ed without

<dd>
Subclassing is creating a derivative work.  Therefore, the terms of the
GPL affect the whole program where you create a subclass of a GPL'ed
class.


<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCPortProgramToGL" NAME="PortProgramToGL">If I port
my program to GNU/Linux, does that mean I have to release it as Free
Software under the GPL or some other Free Software license?</a></h4>

<dd>

In general, the answer is no--this is not a legal requirement.  In
specific, the answer depends on which libraries you want to use and what
their licenses are.  Most system libraries either use the <a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser GPL</a>, or use the GNU GPL plus an
exception permitting linking the library with anything.  These libraries
can be used in non-free programs; but in the case of the Lesser GPL, it
does have some requirements you must follow.

<p>

Some libraries are released under the GNU GPL alone; you must use a
GPL-compatible license to use those libraries.  But these are normally
the more specialized libraries, and you would not have had anything much
like them on another platform, so you probably won't find yourself
wanting to use these libraries for simple porting.

<p>

Of course, your software is not a contribution to our community if it is
not free, and people who value their freedom will refuse to use it.
Only people willing to give up their freedom will use your software,
which means that it will effectively function as an inducement for people
to lose their freedom.

<p>

If you hope some day to look back on your career and feel that
it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society, you
need to make your software free.


<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCCompanyGPLCostsMoney" NAME="CompanyGPLCostsMoney">
I just found out that a company has a copy of a GPL'ed program, and it
costs money to get it.  Aren't they violating the GPL by not making it
available on the Internet?</a></h4>

<dd>

No.  The GPL does not require anyone to use the Internet for
distribution.  It also does not require anyone in particular to
redistribute the program.  And (outside of one special case), even if
someone does decide to redistribute the program sometimes, the GPL
doesn't say he has to distribute a copy to you in particular, or any
other person in particular.
<p>
What the GPL requires is that he must have the freedom to distribute a
copy to you <em>if he wishes to</em>.  Once the copyright holder does
distribute a copy program to someone, that someone can then redistribute
the program to you, or to anyone else, as he sees fit.
<p>

<dt><h4><a HREF="#TOCReleaseNotOriginal" NAME="ReleaseNotOriginal"> Can
I release a program with a license which says that you can distribute
modified versions of it under the GPL but you can't distribute the
original itself under the GPL?</a></h4>

<dd>

No.  Such a license would be self-contradictory.  Let's look at its 
implications for me as a user. 
<p>
Suppose I start with the original version (call it version A), add 
some code (let's imagine it is 1000 lines), and release that modified 
version (call it B) under the GPL.  The GPL says anyone can change 
version B again and release the result under the GPL.  So I (or 
someone else) can delete those 1000 lines, producing version C which 
has the same code as version A but is under the GPL. 
<p>
If you try to block that path, by saying explicitly in the license that 
I'm not allowed to reproduce something identical to version A under 
the GPL by deleting those lines from version B, in effect the license 
now says that I can't fully use version B in all the ways that the GPL 
permits.  In other words, the license does not in fact allow a user to 
release a modified version such as B under the GPL.
