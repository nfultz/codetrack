       A 5 minute guide to installing CodeTrack v.0.99
         (FIRST TIME only; existing users, see below)
  _____________________________________________________________


In a nutshell:  copy files to Apache-owned space, set permissions, specify a return e-mail
address, and go.


 1. Create a directory in the htdocs root space, for example:

    mkdir  /home/httpd/htdocs/codetrack


 2. Unzip and untar the codetrack files to this directory:

    tar -xzvf codetrack.tar.gz /home/httpd/htdocs/codetrack

    (***Windows users can use Winzip, for either the tar.gz or zip)


 3. Set the permissions for the directory so that it is readable and writable by
    the apache owner:

    chown -R nobody.nobody /home/httpd/htdocs/codetrack
    chmod -R 600 ` find /home/httpd/htdocs/codetrack -type f `
    chmod -R 700 ` find /home/httpd/htdocs/codetrack -type d `

    (Windows users can do the same thing through the GUI, just make sure the XML
    files and the attachments directory are writeable.  You may have to set the
    ownership to Administrator.  Thanks, Microsoft!)


 4. To use e-mail notification, edit config.inc.php and set a real return address for codetrack:

    change: DEFINE ("CODETRACK_RETURN_ADDRESS", codetrack@localhost" );

    to:     DEFINE ("CODETRACK_RETURN_ADDRESS", "CodeTrackAdmin@myCompany.com" );

    or:     DEFINE ("CODETRACK_RETURN_ADDRESS", "DoNotReply@foo.org" );


   To *DISABLE* e-mail in CodeTrack, edit config.inc.php, and set
      CODETRACK_ENABLE_EMAIL to FALSE

    SPECIAL NOTE TO PHP-ON-WINDOWS USERS ONLY:

       If you've never used the PHP mail functions on your web server before, edit
       the php.ini file and set the options below.  Note that you might be able
       to use your ISP's SMTP server if you don't have one.  The box running PHP
       does NOT have to be running a mail server (i.e. Exchange) for this to work.

       php.ini:

          SMTP       =  localhost            ;for win32 only
          sendmail_from =  me@localhost.com  ;for win32 only

            to:

          SMTP       =  mailserver.foo.org    ;for win32 only
          sendmail_from =  bob@foo.org        ;for win32 only

     You will need to stop and restart Apache for the changes to take effect
    ____________________________________________________________________________


 5. Fire up a browser and navigate to  http://server-name/codetrack/


 6. Initially, login as the System Admin:

    login:     admin
    password:  codetrack
    project:   Test Project

    After logging in, change your password, set up a few users and your initial
    "real" project.

	That's it!  If you get stuck, please re-read this document, and check
	TROUBLESHOOTING.txt, but feel free to write us at:  codetrack@openbugs.org



Special note for Netscape 4.x users:

   If some (or many) of your users will be accessing CodeTrack via the Netscape 4
   series, you will probably want to uncomment the following setting in codetrack.php:

      #DEFINE ("OPTIONAL_UGLY_NN4_HACK", " WRAP=VIRTUAL ");

        to

      DEFINE ("OPTIONAL_UGLY_NN4_HACK", " WRAP=VIRTUAL ");

   CodeTrack was designed to be 100% W3C compliant as XHTML Strict on
   the client, and unfortunately, in Navigator 4.x when typing a long line inside
   a TEXTAREA box in a form, the words will continue without breaking.  So, a two
   (or ten) sentence bug description will only display the first 80 characters or
   so; the rest will scroll out to the right of the text box.  Technically, there
   is nothing wrong with that, but it means that to read bug reports, you would
   have to constantly scroll the horizontal bar to read the full text. This CodeTrack
   DEFINE setting turns on vendor-proprietary extensions which violate the W3C
   standard, but will be safely ignored on all modern browsers.  We have tested
   this in Mozilla, Opera, and IE, and found that all ignored the attribute and
   displayed without incident.  We have turned this off by default so that all
   bug report pages will validate as 100% W3C compliant.  There is no CSS or
   "legal" HTML equivalent to result in the same behavior, and we are against
   browser detection on general principal.  Again, this is ONLY an issue for the
   Netscape 4.x series browsers.

              (only applies to existing users)
  _____________________________________________________________


1. Backup and save all your current xml files somewhere safe, just in case.

2. Unzip codetrack.tar.gz into a directory in Apache-accessible space.

3. Copy your current XML files to the xml folder

4. If you're on Unix/Linux, set the permissions for the current directory
	and all subs to the owner and group of the webserver (i.e., httpd/httpd),
	and the permissions to 750. If you're on Windows, you shouldn't have
	to change permissions.

5. Fire up a browser and all your accounts, bugs, and passwords should Just Work.

   Note, if you have tweaked your original version, settings in the DEFINE blocks
   of the old codetrack.php will need to replace those in config.inc.php
