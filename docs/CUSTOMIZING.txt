The next block of constants drives most of the form and drop down (DD) choices in CodeTrack.
Customize to your heart's content, but note that THERE SHOULD BE NO SPACES BETWEEN CHOICES!
*Adding* choices is always fine, but be careful about *modifying* existing entries in the
middle of a project, as you risk orphaning existing records.  It might help to think of all
of these lists as master lookup tables. Note: There's NO risk in changing the *x_DEFAULT_x* entries.

A leading comma-only entry (example:  ",Fixed..." ) creates a blank option on drop down and
allows for default null value choice.  See CUSTOMIZING.txt for more info.
